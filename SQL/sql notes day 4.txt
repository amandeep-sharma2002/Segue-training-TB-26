SQL Day 4
-------------
Nested Sub Queries
==================

UC: Display all students that have enrolled in SQL Programming. 

NOTE: We work on single table at a time. 

select sname 
from student
where sid = (select sid 
			 from student_course
			 where cid = (select cid
                          from course 
						  where cname='SQL Programming'))

ERROR 1242 (21000): Subquery returns more than 1 row

select cid
from course 
where cname='SQL Programming'
(1)

select sid 
from student_course
where cid = (1)

 
select sname 
from student
where sid = (1,2)
Note: (1,2) are multiple rows and so cannot be used with = operator. 
 
Solution: Use IN instead of =

select sname 
from student
where sid IN (select sid 
			 from student_course
			 where cid IN (select cid
                          from course 
						  where cname='SQL Programming'))
select sname 
from student
where sid IN (1,2)


UC: display course(s) that belong to IT department. 

select cname
from course
where did IN (select did
			 from department
			 where dname='IT')

select did
from department
where dname='IT'
(1)

select cname
from course
where did IN (1)

UC: display all students that are associated with department 'IT'. 

select sname
from student
where sid IN (select sid 
			  from student_course 
			  where cid IN ( select cid 
							 from course where did IN (select did 
													   from department 
													   where dname='IT')))

Nested Queries on Same table
----------------------------
UC: display all employees that have salary more than 
Average salary of all employees. 

Avg(esalary) = 84000 


select ename,esalary
from employee 
where esalary > (select AVG(esalary) from employee); 

mysql> select ename,esalary
    -> from employee
    -> where esalary > (select AVG(esalary) from employee);
+------------------+---------+
| ename            | esalary |
+------------------+---------+
| harry potter     |   85000 |
| hermione granger |   90000 |
| frodo baggins    |   90000 |

Schema
=======
customer(cid,cname,ccity)
customer_product(cid,pid)
product(pid,pname,price,vid)
vendor(vid,vname)

Query 1: 
Display all products that have price more than average price of all product

Query 2: 
Display all customers who have bought product with name 'Oppo A12'

Query 3: 
display all customers who are associated with vendor with 
name 'ABC Electronics'. 

NOTE: Use Nested Sub Query Technique Only


Q1: 
select pname
from product
where price > (select AVG(price) from product) 

Q2: 
select cname
from customer
where cid IN (select cid 
			  from customer_product 
			  where pid IN (select pid 
						    from product 
							where pname='Oppo A12'))

Q3: 
select cname
from customer
where cid IN (select cid 
			  from customer_product 
			  where pid IN (select pid 
						    from product
							where vid IN (select vid 
									   	  from vendor 
									   	  where vname='ABC Electronics')));
