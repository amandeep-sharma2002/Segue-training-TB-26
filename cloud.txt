Cloud:AWS & Azure 

-> application 

Q. How many end users are going to use this app? 
=> 200,000

Q. How much load(No. of Users) can 1 server handle?
=> 1000 users per server 

Q. How are we going to manage and maintain so many servers? 
Q. What about security? 
=> We go to cloud companies. 


Cloud companies
---------------
- we offer unlimited number of server through our datacenters that are through out the world. 
- we charge you on pay-as-you basis. What ever server you use, we will charge only that much. 
- We will take care of security of your data and application. 

Clouds can be classified into 3 types
- private 
- public 
- hybrid 

PRIVATE CLOUD
=============
=> if a company sets up servers in there own premise, its called as private cloud. 

Disadvantage:
-------------
=> Security exposure

PUBLIC CLOUD
============
=> going to cloud companies, saving data and using servers from their data centers. 

Disadv
------
None

Hybrid CLOUD
============
datacentes + private 


Type of Service Model
=====================
There are 3 types of service. 

1. Infrastructure as a service : you get the server, installation, environment setup, app deploy 

2. Platform as a service: I get a full configured server. Just deploy the app and we are good to use it. 

3. Software as a service: Clouds sell software as well. ex. Accounting, CRM, SCM 


Conclusion: 
===========
As developers, we must prefer Public Cloud with platform-as-a-service model.
